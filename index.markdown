# 👋 Welcome to My Research Page

I am **Shuang Rao**, a master's student in Chemical Engineering at **Lehigh University**.
My research focuses on **computational catalysis**, particularly on **density functional theory (DFT)** studies of **ethanol oxidation** and **reaction thermodynamics** on metal surfaces.

## 🔬 Current Research
- **Ethanol oxidation on Pt(111):**  
  Investigating the electrochemical ethanol oxidation reaction on Pt(111) surfaces using **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** with dispersion corrections.  
  Computed adsorption energies, vibrational frequencies, and potential-dependent free energies for key intermediates using the **Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE)** formalism.  
  Performed **nudged elastic band (NEB)** calculations to determine activation barriers and integrated thermodynamic and kinetic results to identify potential-determining steps and elucidate the complete reaction mechanism on Pt catalysts.


## ⚙️Past Research
- **Ligand Electrochemical Parameter Approach to Molecular Design**  
  Studied the structure–property relationships in a family of molybdenum(0) carbonyl complexes, [L₅Mo(0)(CO)], by varying the electronic characteristics of ligands (L₅).  
  Used **Gaussian** electronic-structure calculations to optimize geometries and analyze **σ-donation** and **π-back-donation** interactions between the metal center and the CO probe molecule.  
  Extracted quantitative descriptors such as Mo–CO bond lengths, C–O bond orders, and CO stretching frequencies, and correlated them with the **Ligand Electrochemical Parameter (EL)** to understand how ligand electron richness tunes CO binding strength.  
  Established linear regressions showing that **π-back-donation** dominates the modulation of CO frequency and bond length across the ligand series, providing a molecular-level rationale for tailoring metal–CO interactions.
