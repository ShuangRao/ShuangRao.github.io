## 洫ｪ Research Log: Ethanol Oxidation on Pt(111)
**Date:** November 9, 2025  

Performed DFT calculations to evaluate adsorption energies for intermediates in the ethanol oxidation reaction on Pt(111).  
Adsorbed species include CH竄イH竄０H*, CH竄イH竄０*, CH竄イHOH*, CH竄イHO*, CH竄イOH*, CH竄イO*, CH竄イOOH*, H*, and OH*.  
All structures optimized with PBE-D3 (IVDW=11, ENCUT=500 eV, ISMEAR=1, SIGMA=0.1 eV, EDIFFG=-0.02 eV ﾃ竅ｻﾂｹ).  


Vibrational frequency analyses were performed to obtain zero-point energies and entropic corrections.  
The **Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE)** model was applied to compute potential-dependent free energies at 298 K.  

**Current focus:** calculating the reaction free-energy changes for each elementary step, constructing a potential-dependent energy diagram, and preparing **NEB** calculations to determine activation barriers for key transformations.
